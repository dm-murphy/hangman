# [Hangman](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization)

### Project

This project highlights file IO and serialization in Ruby. A command line version of the Hangman [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) where users can save and load their game state. 

In this game, the computer randomly generates a secret word from 5 to 12 characters long. The player then guesses a letter that might be in the secret word. Feedback is provided if the letter is contained within the word and its location is revealed in the output. However, if the player guesses a letter that is not included in the secret word, a strike is earned. The player wins by correctly guessing all the secret word's letters before reaching six strikes.
